TP2 Update
Changes -

Put more thought into details of both the image mode and maze mode, and general UI:

Interface ideas:
- Boards will always be square, but the screen will have a 5:6 ratio, what remains after the 1:1 square is used for UI
- Game starts at main menu, can then navigate to image, maze, or race mode
	- If maze mode, opens level selection menu
	- Each mode will have a button to return to the menu

Image ideas:
- Image mode has a "hint" button that will display numbers that correlate to their desired final position
- Image mode will have a "solve" button that will display a star on the next piece that should be moved, based off of and algorithm I create ***
- Menu to select image from existing file in computer to be uploaded (not sure if viable?) ***

Maze Ideas:
- Implemented real colors instead of just shapes
- "How to Play" screen ***
- Universal constrictions for maze mode:
	- Player is limited by time and number of moves to create difficulty
- The maze mode will have ~5 levels, each will have a unique theme (i.e. different game rules, new sprites)
	Some ideas for level rules/themes:
	- Increasing board len for each level (Lv 1/2 = 4, lv 3/4 = 5, lv5 = 6)
	- Certain squares are statically marked (don't move if square moves), these marked squares must be visited by the 	player for the level to complete
	- Certain statically marked squares are not allowed to be visited by player, otherwise they lose
	- Projectiles travel across the screen, if they collide with the player, you lose
	- Combination of above 3 for final level

Race ideas: ***
- Not really main part of project
- Upon selecting race mode, player 1 will be timed to solve a 4x4 slide puzzle
- After completion, player2 will be timed completing the same puzzle
- Fastest player wins

Overall, the image and race mode can be seen as practice for the maze mode, which is the main game.
