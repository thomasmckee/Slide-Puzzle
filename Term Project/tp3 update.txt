The only new thing added was the random level creation for the maze game, and everything that I planned on adding after TP2 was successfully added, except for the "How to Play" screen, as I feel like I covered that in the readme. Also, I converted the grass texture of the maze game into just a plain green background, which I felt kept with the theme a bit more. There was also a lot of general improvements to the interface, but I still kept it fairly simple since I'm not very good with graphic design.
